# Continuous Integration/Deployment

## Continuous Integration
- Gets triggered by source code commits
- Runs any tests for frontend or backend code
- Builds any artifacts (production js files, rails assets)
- Publishes the artifacts (test results to dashboard, or assets to S3)
- Triggers a deploy (in Opsworks)
- Many CI systems are configured by a config file in the source code repo
- Can build multiple branches and only deploy specific branches to specific environments

## CI Providers
- Travis CI
- Circle CI
- CodeShip
- Solano Labs
- Jenkins
  - Java
  - Open source
  - Extensible

## Jenkins
- Jenkins is an open source pluggable build workflow manager with a web UI
Plugins and a public plugin repository allow Jenkins to be integrated with many - services
- Projects are configured in workflow stages:
  - Source Control
  - Build Steps
  - Post Build Steps
- Each stage of the workflow can impact the next step (e.g. on failure)
- Project can be configured to trigger each other
- The web UI shows a dashboard that can visualize build status, as well as test results
