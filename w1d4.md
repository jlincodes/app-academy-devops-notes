## RDS Overview
- RDS provides pre-configured instances of common relational databases
- Because many of the features of these databases are shared across all implementations, the UI provides controls for common features

## Relational Databases
- Data is stored in tables
- Tables stored as rows and columns
- Underlying data-structure is typically a BST or Array (fixed fields)
- Queries (searching) is typically performed via SQL
- Able to relate different tables
- Able to provide different ways to “Key” the BST
- “Primary Key” is typically disk represented
- Able to provide additional “indexes” to increase search speed

## Indexes
Indexes tell the database to also represent the table in a secondary BST (or Hash), with keys only, values pointing to the original record. When querying, the database will try to use the best index available for optimal speed.
- Primary Key Index
- Foreign Key Index
- Prefix Index
- Full Text Index
- Multi-column Index
Indexes will increase lookup speed, but slow inserts/deletes.

## Read Replica
- Master/Slave model
- Master is read/write
- Slave is read only, used for large reads, also used for backups
- Master uses transaction log shipping to update slave
- Indexes can vary between master and slaves

## Backups (Snapshots)
- All database implementations support some way to take a backup of the data
- AWS calls this feature “Snapshots”
- AWS helps you take snapshots and restore them through the UI
- You can also manually take backups in postgres:
  - pg_dump --host=<host1> <dbname1> > latest.dump
  - pg_restore --host=<host2> --dbname=<dbname2> latest.dump


How do we make our databases better?
1. Look at the indexes
2. Scale the DB
  - Master/Slave - one DB is the single source of truth, the others have copies of data (read replicas); can write to master, but not the slaves
  - Shard - separate data into separate servers
    - vertical sharding - monolithic to microservices
    - horizontal sharding - db per client
