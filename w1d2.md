# AWS

## Overview
- Regions
- EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute
  - Instances
  - Key Pairs
  - Volumes (EBS)
  - Load Balancers
  - Security Groups
  - VPC

## AWS
- AWS allows you to get access to computing hardware and pay per hour
- They offer many different machine sizes (different resource allocations) at different pricing rates
- On top of this base offering, there are many different services available
- Other services though are typically just convenience or utility on top of these servers
- S3 is a little different, its storage that pay per data transfer, and storage used
- Most AWS services use open source technology at their core.

## Regions
- Everything (except S3) in AWS is specific to a region
- AWS has data centers across the world and each is managed independently
- California: two data centers close to us
- Of the two, Oregon (us-west-2) is the cheapest (over N. California)
- Make sure to always double check your region when you log in
- We are going to use **Oregon (us-west-2)**
- Think about regions, notice where you are

## EC2 - Instances
- Instances is the primary location to look at the state of the machines you’re using.

## EC2 - Key Pairs
EC2 uses SSH keys to grant you access to the instances you create
On new instance creation, you'll be asked to select a key
You can upload an existing public key, to which you have the private (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
Or allow AWS to create a new one, and download the private key

## EC2 - Volumes (EBS)
- Think of each machine has an external HD
- By default, instances created are completely clean, and any data stored will not persist are machine termination
- You can add persistent storage to any instance using EBS Volumes
- Volumes will be auto-mounted in ubuntu under /mount/
- A volume can only be attached to a single instance at a time
We will not be using EBS storage during our exercises

## EC2 - Load Balancers
- Listeners tab is very important

## EC2 - Security Groups
- Security Groups are applied to all instances and ELBs
- They are similar to a firewall and restrict all traffic destined to that machine according to the configurable rules

## EC2 - VPCs
- VPCs are analogous to an office network
- Inside the VPC, machines can access each other via an internal IP
- Outside, machines are accessible according to sec group rules
- We will be using the default VPC setting for all of the exercises

## RDS (relational database service)
- backups - AWS create read replica

## Cloudfront
- a distributed CDN
It is outside of region settings
can be configured to serve content from an app service or an S3 bucket
can be configured to use a custom domain

## Certificate Manager
- The certificate manager stores any SSL certificates that you wish you use
- We will be using this to enable HTTPS in our application

## Route 53
- Domain name manager
- register new or transfer existing domains to AWS nameserver

## Cloudwatch
- used to monitor the health of your servers
- monitor resources include:
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Network
  - Hard disk
- "Alerts" are configurable in the AWS UI
- Alerts notify devs by email when resource usage passes given thresholds
- Can be integrated with other notification services (PagerDuty)
- When building apps, make sure that your end users are not the first ones to discover problems

## Opsworks
- Enables the automation of machine configuration
- Uses "layers" to specify roles for each machine
- Can use chef or puppet to author setup scripts
- Scripts get triggered by instance lifecycle events
- Deployment scripts can be triggered by API
- Integrates well with other AWS services

## IAM
- allows teams of devs to use the same AWS account, with separate privileges, configured by an admin
- also always you to create roles that are not intended for use by humans, but for API usage

## API, Tokens and CLI
- AWS API requires you to authenticate via 2 tokens:
  - aws_access_key_id
  - aws_secret_access_key
- Tokens can be managed via (Account Name) > “My Security Credentials”
- The easiest way to interact with the AWS API from your local machine is to use the - aws_cli tool
- The tool, as well as other AWS libraries, look for credentials in 2 files under - ~/.aws:
  - credentials
  - config
- The config file stores the default region setting (us-west-2)
